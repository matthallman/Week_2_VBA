# ElectionAnalysis

## Project Overview
In addition to providing winning candidate info we are asked to provide the voter turnout and the total percentage of votes from each county, highlighting the county with the highest turnout. 

### Resources
I worked using Python in VScode, analyzing CSV election results. 

## Election Audit Results

 - Denver County: 82.8% (306,055)
 - Arapahoe County: 6.7% (24,801)
 - The largest voter turnout was in Denver County with 306,055.

### Candidate vote breakdown: Percentage & Total Votes
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8 (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthon Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
  
#### Election Winner
  - Diana DeGette 
    - Winning Vote Count: 272,898
    - Winning Percentage: 73.8% 


### Challenge Summary
This code should be able to be used in the next election with minimal changes needed besides changing the location of the election_results file.
